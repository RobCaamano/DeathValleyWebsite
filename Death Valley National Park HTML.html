		<h1> Death Valley National Park </h1>
		<h2> CA, NV </h2>

		<h3> Opening and Closing Times: </h3>
		<p>
		The park is open 24 hours every day.
		</p>	

		<h3> Must See Highlights: </h3>		
		<ul>
			<li> <b>Badwater Basin:</b> Badwater Basin is the lowest elevation in North America at - 282 feet (- 86 m) below sea level. 
			A visit to this otherworldly salt flat will provide you with a unique experience and a landscape that appears to stretch on forever. 
			A short 1/4 mile (400 m) hike will you bring you to the polygon salt formations that Death Valley is famous for, or in the summer months, 
			the view can be enjoyed from the parking area.</li>
			<li> <b>Artists Drive:</b> Enjoy a scenic drive through a geologic rainbow! Artists Drive is a one-way, nine mile drive that passes through eroded, 
			colorful desert hills. A stop at Artists Palette along the way, either from the car window or a short walk, will provide the most colorful views. 
			Enjoy geology and scenic vistas along this trip! </li>
			<li> <b>Devils Golf Course:</b> An immense area of rock salt eroded by wind and rain into jagged spires. So incredibly serrated that 
			"only the devil could play golf on such rough links". Listen carefully and you'll hear sounds like tiny pops and pings. 
			Bend your ear to the ground and the sound grows louder. The sound is literally billions of tiny salt crystals bursting apart as 
			they expand and contract in the heat.</li>
			<li> <b>Golden Canyon:</b> A labyrinth landscape of golden colored hills and winding narrow canyons create hiking options ranging from easy strolls 
			to strenuous adventures. The most popular routes can be combined with one another for longer adventures, up about 4.5 miles. Regardless which 
			adventure is right for you, take the map and route description with you. </li>
			<li> <b>Zabriskie Point:</b> The most famous viewpoint in the park. Overlooking the golden colored badlands of the Furnace Creek formation, visitors 
			can simply enjoy the view or elect to start the hike from the point around Badlands Loop. Connector trails lead to Golden Canyon, Gower Gulch, 
			and Red Cathedral. The point is most popular at sunrise and sunset. </li>

					<li> <b>Barker Ranch:</b> Barker Ranch was built by recreational ranchers who wanted to live in solitude and enjoy the simplicities 
					of life. Bluth and Helen Thomason aquired the property in the 1930s where they both wished to try their luck at mining. In 1940, 
					a stone cabin was built that had a spring nearby for drinking water and electricity was generated by a windmill. After Jim and 
					Arlene Barker purchased the ranch in 1955 they enlarged the house to have large family gatherings. The infamous Manson family 
					occupied this ranch for a brief period of time from 1968 to 1969. Some of the family members burned an NPS tractor which caught 
					the attention of law enforcement officials. After Barker Ranch was raided and the Manson family members were jailed for vandalism, 
					it became appearant they were involved with horrific murders in Los Angeles. In May 2009, Barker Ranch was destroyed in an accidental 
					fire. </li>
